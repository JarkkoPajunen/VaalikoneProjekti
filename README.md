Election Machine Project
Project Description
This project encompassed the development of an election machine system, with a focus on both frontend and backend components. The backend, implemented with JSP, housed a database for registering candidate information. The frontend, designed with HTML, provided a user-friendly interface for accessing and displaying candidate details. The database was set up locally using MySQL, ensuring a seamless integration between the data storage and the interactive user interface.

Technologies Used
Backend: JSP (Java Server Pages)
Database: MySQL (Local Setup)
Frontend: HTML

Features:
Robust local MySQL database for storing and retrieving candidate information.
User-friendly frontend interface crafted with HTML for accessible candidate data visualization.
Seamless integration between frontend and backend through JSP, ensuring real-time data accessibility.

Learning Experiences and Achievements
Throughout this project, I honed my skills in full-stack development, especially in managing databases with MySQL, developing backend logic with JSP, and crafting user interfaces with HTML. This project provided a solid platform to understand and implement the principles of seamless integration between frontend and backend technologies.
